To complete this adapter you will need a new oracle contract address (OCA) on remix:

  https://remix.xinfin.network/

Create new contract name:

oracle.sol

Contents:

pragma solidity 0.4.24;
import "@goplugin/contracts/src/v0.4/Oracle.sol";

On the Compile tab, click the Compile button for Oracle.sol.

On the Deploy and Run tab, configure the following settings:

Select "Injected Web3" as your Environment. The Javascript VM environment cannot access your oracle node.

Select the "Oracle" contract from the Contract menu.

Copy the PLI token contract address for the network:

Mainnet:
0xff7412ea7c8445c46a8254dfb557ac1e48094391

Apothem(testnet):
0x33f4212b027e22af7e6ba21fc572843c0d701cd1

Paste it into the address_link field next to the Deploy button.

Now login to you node and copy the node regular address into the fufillemt area, replacing node address with your own:

"node_address",true

Click deploy.
